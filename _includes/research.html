            I am interested in problems that involve combining domain knowledge with pattens learned from noisy and uncertain data.

            Before joining UTD, I was a Master&rsquo;s student at <a class="strong" href="https://www.iu.edu/">Indiana
                University</a>. I worked with <a class="strong" href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~djcran/">Prof. David
                Crandall</a> on
            bayesian uncertainty quantification algorithms for deep neural networks. I completed my M.S. in May 2020.

            As an undergraduate student at <a class="strong" href="http://vit.ac.in/">Vellore Institute of
                Technology</a>,
            I worked with <a class="strong" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JM-KG70AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof.
                Daphne Lopez</a> on deep models for image caption generation and chatbots. I have interned at <a
                            class="strong" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in">Microsoft, Bangalore</a> during my undergrad and <a
                            class="strong" href="https://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys, Mountain View</a> during my masters.
